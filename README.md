# Maze

One of the first challenges I had was using XR Origin instead of XR Rig. This caused my controllers to not show up. However, Akhil really helped with this issue and I used this video https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d2gEEQeu1b4 to help set up the controllers. Since I used the XR Origin, a few other settings were different from the lesson videos - I noticed a difference between the layers that you can set at the top of a game object's inspector panel, and the interaction layer masks (for example, in the XR Grab Interactable component of the key game object). If I created a new layer in one of these places, it wasn't available in the other. Ultimately this didn't cause too much of an issue, but it was interesting that it deviated from the lesson videos. 

While exploring my maze with the headset, I noticed is that if you get really close to the walls and doors you can lean forward and poke your head through into the next room. It seems like this is a common issue, and something that many students encounter.

Once I had created the first key and door, it was really easy to create the second set - I just had to write a short script to deactivate the first key so that the player would need to search for a second one in order to get to the end. 

I didn't end up including additional assets, but I look forward to using probuilder more to create custom objects!
